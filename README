These CGI programs have been on my personal web site for a number
of years.  They are now released under the GNU public license for
anyone to use.  They have been compiled using gcc on RedHat Linux.

I have included copies of the input HTML pages to illustrate the
use of the CGIs.  These pages are in the directory html.

The Sunrise/Sunset CGI uses public domain code -- please read the
notice at the top of the files.

Updates of this package should be available from:
